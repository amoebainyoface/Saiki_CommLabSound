Project Name: 
<i>Deserted</i> 

Project Description:
The project is a simulation of a vintage personal computer system of the mysterious local guide Mohammed. Through interacting with the various audio recordings and phone calls, a sinister tale of the red desert unfolds witnessed via the archive of perhaps the final days of the main character’s life.

Process:
The project initially was though to be an aesthetic and therapeutic soundscape featuring ambience of a person’s journey into the desert. After group discussions and inspiration from Khalifa’s stories about the local ghost tales and urban legends around the desert, we decided to go for a menacing twist. During the ideation process, we thought about going for a Blair Witch Project found footage style but instead of video, it is an audio archive. The story of a tourist going to an uncharted territory captured through the local guide’s computer felt very creepy and leaves an unsettling feeling.<br>
Khalifa and I did the audio work while Douglas and Ahsen worked on the code. Khalifa played the local on call and I played as the main character. I worked on the last 3 audio recording which feature the tourist’s descent into madness. Using Audacity and sound effects from NYU Stock, I tried to create a creepy vibe through:<br>

<ul>
  <li>Using repetition of static noises.</li><br>
  <li>Modulating my voice (using the devil’s triad to get a demonic sounding dialogue in the last audio recording). </li><br>
  <li>Howling Desert ambience and a scary music theme from YouTube.
</li><br>
</ul>
Reflection/Evaluation:
This was very fun project to participate in and make. While we think we can furnish both audio and the site to feel more authentic, we are satisfied with we came up with. Ideation around a horror story in a group setting is very engaging and fun, especially when it is audio related because sound cues are everything in such a genre and this led to a lot of brainstorming with what might be effective. I personally feel the mixing of the audio was pretty good but it would have also been fun to record foley on top of the original dialogues we recorded. Overall, I feel the windows 95 aesthetic with creepy audio files remind me of early technophobia which always situates myself in a sci-fi/horror setting and it only works to get the intention across.
